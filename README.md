This project replicates an image carousel with smooth scrolling and zooming features using SwiftUI. The carousel behaves like a typical image carousel where users can swipe through images, and the currently visible image is zoomed in. The project implements the carousel view with the following key features:

1. **Smooth Scrolling**: The carousel moves smoothly when the user scrolls, without erratic behavior.
2. **Pagination**: When the user stops scrolling, the carousel automatically centers on the nearest tile.
3. **Zooming Effect**: The image in the middle zooms in as it comes to the center.
4. **No Third-Party Libraries**: Only built-in SwiftUI components are used.
5. **Adaptive Layout**: The carousel's height adapts based on the content, ensuring it resizes automatically when views are added above or below.

### Features

- **Scrollable Carousel**: You can interact with the carousel by panning around the images.
- **Zoom Effect**: Images zoom in when they are at the center of the carousel.
- **Auto Page Control**: The carousel uses a page control to indicate the current image.
- **Resizable**: The carousel view adjusts its height dynamically based on the surrounding views.

### Demo

You can view a demo of the carousel in action below:
